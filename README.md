# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Projects

This repository contains the projects for courses in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. This professional certificate contains 9 courses. These are as follows:
1. What is Data Science?
2. Tools for Data Science
3. Data Science Methodology
4. Python for Data Science and AI
5. Databases and SQL for Data Science
6. Data Analysis with Python
7. Data Visualization with Python
8. Machine Learning with Python
9. Applied Data Science Capstone

Project/assignment notebooks for courses 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are included in this repository. Courses 1 and 3 only have quizzes as part of their assignments. Hence, there are no notebooks for them.

The last course, Applied Data Science Capstone, has multiple submissions. These include:
1. A basic introduction to the capstone project notebook for week 1 of the course
2. An assignment notebook for week 3 of the course
3. The final project notebook, report, and presentation.

All of the files mentioned above can be found at https://github.com/raunakbhutoria/Coursera_Capstone. The Coursera_Capstone repository was the one used for making all submissions for the capstone course. Thus, in this repository I will only be including the Week 3 assignment notebook and the final project code notebook. In order to get the report, presentation, and other materials for the capstone course, please visit the Coursera_Capstone repository.
